# Bro-T-Woser
A C# web browser, made for simple browsing, embedding, and open source, hackable web experiences.


The "Bro T Woser" runs using the NuGet packages: HtmlAgilityPack, and WebView2
It browses the web, using HTML, CSS, and JS and has quick acess buttons for wikipedia, stackoverflow, github, and outlook

This web browser is targeted for embedded use, I do not recommend daily driver use, even though It is a fine experience there are obviously lacking features, like extensions and settings that would normally be built into the browser.

This browser DOES have user data encryption in its data storage folder, it WILL store userdata in an encrypted format. If you wish to remove this data go to C:\ProgramData\PrjT and delete the root folder PrjT

This browser is NOT designed for secure browsing, even though it is technically secure it wont recive the same support as a much better browser like edge, duckduckgo, or brave would, and as such I really dont reccomend it as a browser for daily driving, or secure data, but if you wish to create a easly restrictable browser for kids, or teenagers on a computer, and dont want to deal with the security hassles of other browsers, this is the one for you.

EXPECT UPDATES CHECK GIT FREQUENTLY TO GET THE LATEST PATCHES, FEATURES, AND THEMES!

remember to install the following to execute the program:

Visual studio -- NOT REQUIRED, BUT HANDY FOR EDITING AND COMPILING
WebView2 Nuget pack -- used to... Webview I think?
HtmlAgilityPack Nuget Pack -- create URL paths to browse
